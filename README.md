**Abstract:** Understanding evolutionary co-ordination among different life-history traits is a key challenge for ecology and evolution. Here, we develop a general quantitative model predicting how offspring size should scale with adult size by combining a simple model for life-history evolution with a frequency-dependent survivorship model. The key innovation is that larger offspring are afforded three different advantages during ontogeny: higher survivorship per time, a shortened juvenile phase, and advantage during size-competitive growth. In this model, it turns out that size-asymmetric advantage during competition is the factor driving evolution towards larger offspring sizes. For simplified and limiting cases the model is shown to produce the same predictions as the previously existing theory it is founded on. The explicit treatment of different survival advantages has biologically important new effects, mainly through an interaction between total maternal investment in reproduction and the duration of competitive growth. This leads on to explain alternative allometries between log offspring size and log adult size, as observed in mammals (slope=0.95) and plants (slope=0.54). Further, it suggests how these differences relate quantitatively to specific biological processes during recruitment. In these ways the model generalizes across previous theory and provides explanations for some differences between major taxa.

## Instructions

All analyses were done in `R`. To reproduce the key results from this paper, run the code contained in the `analysis.R` file. 

If reproducing these results on your own machine, you much first install the package [smatr](cran.r-project.org/package=smatr), described in [Warton et al 2013](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00153.x):
  
```
install.packages('smatr')
```

Alternatively, you can use an interactive RStudio session to run the `analysis.R` file with the required software pre-installed. This session is hosted by binder and can be accessed by clicking on the following:

Note the equations in the figures 4-6 were added outside of R so will not be visible in the generated figures.

A separate file  `analytical_solutions.m` contains matlab code used to derive the analytical solution reported in the paper.

## Further details

- This code was archived post-publication, so there is no link to the code at the journal's website.
- The code included in this release has been slightly restructured to improve readability and code quality. Original code was written between 2006-2008 by Daniel Falster, then updated in 2014. The version run at time of publication is available [here](https://github.com/dfalster/Falster_2008_AmNat_offspring_model/tree/c06c5de3a54b4589581b2f74b2c9fc5d1529fd6d) (NB - does not include data). While I have endeavoured to make the code more readable, it's still a little arcane - my apologies for that.
- More information about the data used in this analysis is available in the file [data/README.md](data/README.md)
